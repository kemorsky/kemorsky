## Hello there

I'm Kamil.

Frontend Developer • ADHD and coffee fueled tech enthusiast

## Who am I?

I write code (that I forget to put on git before half-way through the project far too often. Though I am getting better!) and dabble in some light game development. Ever heard of Skyrim? Well, I'm working on creating her neighboring lands as part of Beyond Skyrim.

I'm based in Gothenburg, Sweden and I focus on creating usser-friendly and seamless designs and interfaces.

## What am I currently working on?

I'm currently working on a fullstack mobile app in Expo (React Native). I wrote the backend myself in GraphQL and I'm currently putting finishing touches on its functions. Next stop is making the app run and look pretty!
